# table Redux
Table visualizer for Open Kim using React and Redux

to run locally you need to have an updated version of Node and NPM (Node Package manager)
If you do not have these you can either download and install them or you can use
NVM node version manager.

Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
NPM: https://github.com/npm/npm

Once Node and NPM are installed open a terminal and navigate to the folder you downloaded this code to

Then run "npm install"
and 
"npm start"

This will start up a webserver and should automatically load the page.
